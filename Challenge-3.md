# Challenge 3 – API, UI Development and CRUD Operations
## 1. Setup Your Development Environment
Use IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code.
1.  convert php3 to golang
2.  write documentation for the converted golang code
   
## 4. Use the Model Class for the Following JSON

```json
[
    {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Laptop",
        "description": "A high-performance laptop suitable for gaming and work.",
        "price": 1200.00
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "Smartphone",
        "description": "A latest-generation smartphone with a large display and powerful camera.",
        "price": 800.00
    },
    {
        "id": "3",
        "name": "Wireless Headphones",
        "description": "Noise-cancelling wireless headphones with long battery life.",
        "price": 200.00
    },
    {
        "id": "4",
        "name": "Smartwatch",
        "description": "A smartwatch with fitness tracking and customizable watch faces.",
        "price": 150.00
    },
    {
        "id": "5",
        "name": "Tablet",
        "description": "A lightweight tablet with a sharp display, ideal for reading and browsing.",
        "price": 300.00
    }
]
```
### 5. Read and Write to the JSON file 
### 6. Perform CRUD operations using REST Controller 
GET, PUT, POST, DELETE using the annotations 
•	GET /api/items: Retrieve all items. 
•	GET /api/items/{id}: Retrieve an item by its ID. 
•	POST /api/items: Create a new item. 
•	PUT /api/items/{id}: Update an existing item. 
•	DELETE /api/items/{id}: Delete an item. 
### 7. Add Exception handling
### 8. You are free to use a database instead of a json file for crud operations.
 
## Challenge 4 – UI
1.  Create UI in ReactJS for the converted golang code as the backend. 
2.	Display the data In the table format on UI 
3.	Perform CRUD operations 

## Challenge 5 – Add Test Cases
1.	Write the test cases for the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations 
2.	Include edge cases and null conditions
3.	Write unit tests using copilot for the converted golang code
4.	Write integration test for the converted golang code. 
5.	Run the test cases
